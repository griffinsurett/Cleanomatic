            For over 22 years, David Derhi has been a trusted name in Monmouth

          <p class={paragraphClass}>
            David’s roots go back to a strong family work ethic. After
            immigrating to America, he took on various jobs—eventually launching
            his own car service and later a restaurant. But it was in the world
            of professional cleaning where he found his true calling. With
            passion and perseverance, Cleanomatic quickly became a household
            name.

            often request that he come when their kids are home, just so they
            can watch him work. He’s been invited to weddings, bar mitzvahs, and

            They’re pleasant to work for.”
