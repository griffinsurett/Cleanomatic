      <p>
        David starts every job with a close inspection—identifying fabric type, soil level, and any trouble spots. Then he applies a targeted pretreatment that loosens oils, body soils, and everyday spills without over‑wetting.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Next, our low‑moisture extraction tool drives powerful suction right through the fibers, pulling out moisture along with the grime. Your upholstery dries in under 4 hours* and feels entirely renewed.

      <p>
        Beyond stain removal, David seals cleaned fibers to ward off future spills and dust. That means fewer stains setting in, softer cushions longer, and less allergy‑trigger buildup over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        From delicate velvets to durable microsuedes, our process adapts to every weave—bringing out the original color and texture without harsh chemicals or residue.
