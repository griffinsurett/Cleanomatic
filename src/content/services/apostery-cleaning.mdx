      <p>
        David starts every job with a close inspection—identifying fabric type,
        soil level, and any trouble spots. Then he applies a targeted
        pretreatment that loosens oils, body soils, and everyday spills without
        over-wetting.

      <br />
      <p>
        Next, our low-moisture extraction tool drives powerful suction right
        through the fibers, pulling out moisture along with the grime. Your
        upholstery dries in under 4 hours* and feels entirely renewed.

      <p>
        Beyond stain removal, David seals cleaned fibers to ward off future
        spills and dust. That means fewer stains setting in, softer cushions
        longer, and less allergy-trigger buildup over time.

        From delicate velvets to durable microsuedes, our process adapts to
        every weave—bringing out the original color and texture without harsh
        chemicals or residue.
