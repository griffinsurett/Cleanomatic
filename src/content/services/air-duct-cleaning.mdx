Our professional air duct cleaning service thoroughly removes builtâ€‘up dust, pollen, mold spores, and other airborne contaminants trapped within your HVAC ductwork, resulting in significantly improved indoor air quality for you and your family. By restoring optimal airflow and reducing system resistance, we help your heating and cooling equipment operate more efficiently, which can lower your energy bills by up to 15% and extend the lifespan of your HVAC system. Our technicians follow EPA guidelines to assess when cleaning is needed and use truckâ€‘mounted vacuum systems along with specialized rotary brushes to safely dislodge and extract debris without harming your ductwork. We also inspect for signs of moisture intrusion and microbial growth, addressing any issues immediately to prevent future mold proliferation and associated health risks.
