        Clogged dryer vents are one of the leading causes of household fires. Every ounce of lint removed lowers that riskâ€”David uses highâ€‘speed rotary brushes to dislodge debris, then powerful vacuums to haul it away.

        With clear beforeâ€‘andâ€‘after camera footage, youâ€™ll see exactly where blockages wereâ€”and know youâ€™re safe when your dryer runs.

        A freeâ€‘flowing exhaust not only dries clothes up to 30% faster but also puts less strain on your applianceâ€”extending its service life and shaving dollars off energy bills.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Davidâ€™s team finishes with a full system checkâ€”verifying vent integrity, seals, and clearancesâ€”so you get both safety and performance in one service.
