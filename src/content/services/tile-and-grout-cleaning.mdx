title: "Tile and Grout Cleaning"
description: "Our professional tile and grout cleaning service employs specialized hot water extraction equipment to blast away deepâ€‘seated dirt, grime, and allergens from porous grout lines and tile surfaces, restoring your floorsâ€™ original shine and color. After cleaning, we apply a premium grout sealer that acts as an invisible barrier against future stains and moisture intrusion, greatly extending the life and beauty of your tile installations. For highâ€‘traffic or sanitary environments, we use electrostatic spraying of hospitalâ€‘grade germicides to eliminate harmful bacteria and ensure a hygienic finish. Our technicians begin with a thorough assessment to identify tile type and any damage, select the ideal pHâ€‘balanced cleaning solutions, handâ€‘scrub grout lines where necessary, and finish with highâ€‘pressure vacuum extraction for rapid drying."
