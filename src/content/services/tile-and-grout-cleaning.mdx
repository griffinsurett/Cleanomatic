        Tile and grout collect dirt in porous lines and slipâ€‘hazard residue on surfaces. David uses an adjustableâ€‘pressure hot water lance that safely loosens grime, then handâ€‘scrubs stubborn spots with precision tools.

        Our highâ€‘powered vacuum extraction removes every drop of dirty waterâ€”leaving tile bright and grout pores boneâ€‘dry.

        Clean grout is still vulnerableâ€”so we handâ€‘apply a premium sealer that fills pores and repels spills, oils, and mildew. Floors stay cleaner, floors stay safer.

        In moistureâ€‘prone areas like showers or entryways, we finish with a quickâ€‘dry spray that adds an invisible barrier against bacteria and dirt.
